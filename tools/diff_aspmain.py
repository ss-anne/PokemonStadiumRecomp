"""diff_aspmain.py — divergence diff between Stadium's recompiled
aspMain and Ares' RSP-side execution of the same ucode.

Why this exists:
    Stadium hangs in aspMain at 0x1038 ==> 0x103C ==> 0x1048 ==> 0x10EC
    (4-PC dispatch loop). Static analysis can't tell us *why* the
    cycle is structurally infinite — we need an oracle (Ares) running
    the same ROM to point at where the recompiled code first diverged
    from real RSP behavior.

How it works:
    1. Connect to Stadium's debug server (port 4371). Stadium is
       running its recompiled aspMain, which after ~200ms has entered
       the hang. Read the live pc_trail snapshot
       (ring of 32 most-recent PCs visited).
    2. Spawn ares_oracle_server (port 4372) on the same baserom and
       step Ares forward to the point where the *first* RSP task
       fires (--ares-frames, default 60 — matches engine smoke).
    3. Search Ares' RSP trace ring for the longest prefix of
       Stadium's pc_trail that appears verbatim. The first PC in
       Stadium's trail that does NOT appear in Ares' trace at the
       expected position is the divergence point.
    4. Dump Ares' GPR + DMA register snapshot at the divergence point
       so the user can see what the oracle expected vs what Stadium
       actually did.

Usage:
    python tools/diff_aspmain.py [--stadium-port 4371] [--ares-port 4372]
                                 [--rom baserom.z64] [--ares-frames 60]
                                 [--oracle-server <path>]

Stadium must already be running (the harness only orchestrates Ares).
