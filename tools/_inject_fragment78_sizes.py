"""Patch fragment78.s for N64Recomp consumption.

Fragment78 is unusual: only the entry trampoline `func_8FF00020` (12
instructions ending in `jr $ra`) is real code. Splat detected dozens of
other `glabel func_XXX` symbols inside the rest of the fragment, but the
bytes there are pure animation/model data — they happen to disassemble
to mostly-invalid MIPS, and N64Recomp chokes when trying to recompile
them as functions (e.g. "Failed to analyze func_8FF0C7B4" from a `lw`
with -3226 stack offset).

Fix: tell the assembler the truth about the fragment shape:

  1. `func_8FF00020` is a function with size 0x1C, ending right after
     its `jr $ra` delay slot at offset 0x3C of the fragment.
  2. Every other `glabel func_XXX` is data — convert it to `dlabel`
     so the ELF symbol type is NOTYPE rather than @function. N64Recomp
     skips NOTYPE symbols when populating section_functions[].

This lets fragment78 register as a section with one function (the
entry), and Stadium's runtime J trampoline at the fragment base
dispatches into it cleanly.

Run after every splat regen of asm/us/fragments/78/fragment78.s.
