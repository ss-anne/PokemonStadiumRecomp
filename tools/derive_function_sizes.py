derive_function_sizes.py — compute sizes for zero-size FUNC symbols.

pret's hand-written assembly (hasm) functions land in the ELF as
`FUNC GLOBAL` symbols with size=0 because the assembler doesn't emit
.size directives for them. N64Recomp can't recompile them without
knowing the byte length, so any caller emits "No function found
for jal target" errors.

This script reads the ELF symbol table, sorts FUNC symbols by VRAM
within each section, and computes each zero-size symbol's implied
size as `(next_symbol_vram - this_vram)` capped at the section end.
Emits a TOML fragment of `[[input.function_sizes]]` entries, which
we splice into game.toml.

Usage:
  python3 tools/derive_function_sizes.py > tools/derived_function_sizes.toml

Then merge the output into game.toml's [[input.function_sizes]]
section.

Per project principles: this is NOT a stub. We are recovering real
function sizes from the ELF that pret already built — we're not
inventing behavior. The same data is observable via readelf;
N64Recomp just doesn't auto-derive it itself yet (that's the engine
fix to upstream).
